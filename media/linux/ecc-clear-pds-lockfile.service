# This is a systemd startup service file that will ensure that the PDS
# synchronizer lock file is removed upon reboot (e.g., if the machine
# freezes or is rebooted in the middle of a PDS synchronizer run).
#
# 1. Place a copy of this file in /etc/systemd/system
# 2. Edit the file to reflect the correct directory where the lockfile
#    is located (usually the home directory of the user owning the
#    cron job that invokes the PDS synchronizer).
# 3. sudo systemctl enable ecc-clear-pds-lockfile.service
#
# That's it.
#
# You can test the systemd service by:
#
#   touch /directory/of/lockfile/pds-run-all.lock
#   sudo reboot
#
# And upon reboot, check to see if the lockfile is there.  If it's not
# (and the cron job is not running!), then this systemd service worked
# properly.
#
# You can also run the following to check its status:
#
#   sudo systemctl status ecc-clear-pds-lockfile.service
#
# It should show an either obviously happy or sad message about the
# status of the service.
