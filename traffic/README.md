This represents the final state of the traffic study from Feb 2020.

The files in this directory are as follows:

* traffic.csv: The CSV export from https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ft1Y0J7G7rDdPe7PqGH-z3NBGpcsonpJMMBGEiPmof4/edit#gid=0, and edited to remove all extraneous rows/columns except the ones containing data.

* traffic-graphit.py: Python script used to create the graphs.
    * Requires Python3 and Matplotlib

* `4-hourly-plot.*`: Plots, grouping the data into 4-hour blocks in columns.
* `hourly-plot.*`: Same data, but the columns are 1-hour blocks.
