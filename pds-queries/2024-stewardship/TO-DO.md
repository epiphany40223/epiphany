Jeff's to-do list:

A thought from April 2022..

Expand the HTML email sent to Families to include a bullet list
of the ministries for each Member who is active/chair.  This
allows people to see a nice summary list in an easy-to-read
format.  NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY STILL NEED TO SUBMIT
EVEN IF THERE ARE NO CHANGES!

E.g (off the top of my head):

1. Jeff Squyres
    * Tech Committee
2. Tracy Squyres
    * PPC
    * Musicians
3. Kaitlyn Squyres
    * Lectors

#-----------------------------------------

* Update the initial-email.html from last year
* Update logo in Jotform thank you page
* Update logo in Jotform email

* Show/hide the 3 messages on the financial Jotform page based on
  whether they gave in stewardship / campaign.
* Get verbiage from Mary/Angie for the 3 cases
    * Run report to see if there's anyone who gave $0 via stewardship
      this year but gave >$0 via campaign

* Update "thank you" email per the text Angie put in
  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D7UiZUf3A2smcLyXsEEuFSWLXlMvdaNBBBJHF8Fvbl4/edit

* Update Python and Jotform to match PDS ministry names

* set favicon on stewardship.ecc.org

* emails not sent do not have codes (or URLs?)
* Make a separate spreadsheet for all the codes

* Enable full Jotform subscription

* Post ministry PDFs
  * Post 600 PDF (waiting for PDF from Angie)

* Acolytes, Greeters, Lectors, Communion ministers
  * If they are involved at all, do no pre-populate
  * If they are not involved, pre-populate to "not involved"

* Add Test Family to Acolytes or something
  * Send example to Angie+Jen+Mary
  * Do Angie/Jen/Mary want any changes?  E.g., is the "do not
    pre-populate" issue only for Communion ministers?
