A thought from April 2022..

Expand the HTML email sent to Families to include a bullet list
of the ministries for each Member who is active/chair.  This
allows people to see a nice summary list in an easy-to-read
format.  NEED TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT THEY STILL NEED TO SUBMIT
EVEN IF THERE ARE NO CHANGES!

E.g (off the top of my head):

1. Jeff Squyres
    * Tech Committee
2. Tracy Squyres
    * PPC
    * Musicians
3. Kaitlyn Squyres
    * Lectors
