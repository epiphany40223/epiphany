# Census 2023

Much of this is directly copied from the Census 2022 folder.

Minor tweaks have been made for adjustments each year in the Census,
but overall the architecture is more-or-less the same.

There are lengthy README.md files in prior census year directories; I
have not copied it forward to this year's directory for the following
reasons:

1. The overall architecture and scheme of the census is more-or-less
   the same as it has been in prior years.
1. That being said, minor changes and tweaks occur each year.  I have
   not been good about updating the README.md to match the specific
   behavior for that year.

As such, I do not want to give the connotation that a README.md file
in this directory precisely describes the behavior in this directory.
Rather, it would be best to read the README.md in a prior census
year's directory and use that as a general guide to the architecture
and behavior of this directory.
